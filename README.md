# Agentic configs

Repo holds config files for agentic code tools; currently only `opencode`.

- `opencode/AGENTS.md` documents repo-wide agent rules.
- `opencode/agent/ask.md` guides the explainer agent's tone and remit.
- `opencode/agent/plan.md` specifies the planner agent's process and outputs.
- `opencode/opencode.jsonc` locks the active agents, models, and permissions.
- `opencode/plugin/notification.js` fires the voice notification when a session finishes.
